ThyroSecure is a machine learning project aimed at early detection of thyroid issues (such as hyperthyroidism) and providing personalized dietary recommendations based on thyroid levels. The project uses supervised learning to analyze patient data and predict thyroid conditions, followed by generating tailored diet suggestions to help manage thyroid health.

Project Structure-

thy.py: 
This is the core Python script responsible for:
Processing patient data.
Detecting thyroid levels based on input data.
Providing dietary recommendations according to thyroid conditions (normal, hyperthyroid, hypothyroid).

hyperthyroid.csv: This dataset contains historical data used for training the model to detect hyperthyroidism based on specific thyroid indicators.

test.csv: A test dataset used to evaluate the model's performance and to simulate real-time predictions of thyroid levels.

Features-
Thyroid Level Detection: Using patient data, the model predicts whether a patient has normal thyroid levels, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism.
Dietary Recommendations: Based on the prediction, the program provides customized dietary advice to help manage thyroid health. For example, patients with hyperthyroidism might receive recommendations to avoid iodine-rich foods.

Usage-

Execute the thy.py script to detect thyroid levels and receive dietary recommendations:

Copy code
python thy.py

Input Data:

Ensure that your input data (in CSV format) follows the structure provided in the hyperthyroid.csv and test.csv files.
